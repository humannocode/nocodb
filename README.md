# Project Page: Extending NocoDB with features of relevance for humanitarian use cases

## What is this about? 
This repository is a fork of NocoDB, an Open Source Airtable clone (please see NocoDB's repository and website for more information). 

In winter 2022/2023 we (flisowna and spaudanjo) had the pleasure to contribute certain features to NocoDB - features that we consider as relevant not only, but especially for the domain of humanitarian aid and NGO work. 

This was possible because of the support of a scholarship we got granted from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), with strong involvement of the Open Knowledge Foundation and the DLR (German Aerospace Center). Find more information about the funding program (Prototypefund) and how to apply here (WEBSITE HERE). 

Since our goal was not to create a permanent fork with the additional features, but instead to directly contribute to the official main repository, the  purpose of this forked repository is focused on: 
* high-level documentation our contributions and how it could be used by NGOs and other actors/users
* acting as our issue board for organizing our work during the project phase, without interfering with the issues of the official repository

## Motivation and background of the project
A lot of critical humanitarian aid is often provided at the beginning of crises by spontaneous helpers who quickly organize themselves on site. 

However, there is often a lack of effective, digital, and freely accessible tools that are flexible enough to, for example, organize logistical processes or the registration of people in need of help and helpers individually, efficiently, and in compliance with data protection regulations. Classically, most digital solutions require programming services or rely on paid applications. 

This can make it difficult for rapid emergency aid to transition to a sustainable, long-term operating mode for organizations. 

Quick and free access to digital organizational tools can make a significant, positive difference in the speed, effectiveness, and sustainability of humanitarian work. 
Some No Code platforms are already addressing this issue, but there is still a lot of room to grow, also in the open-source area. 
We identified some features that we wanted to add to the already very established platform NocoDB (see feature details below). 

Thus, the main goal of our project was to make Open Source Nocode tools like NocoDB even more interesting for NGOs, as an option to quickly test, deploy, and adapt critical applications without commissioning their own developers - which is especially in crisis situations often a scarce resource.
